                    Nexclap is an eLearning platform partnered with Siliconvalley4u that offers a wide range of courses. I'm excited to be part of the team that's transforming Nexclap into an innovative, AI-powered social network aimed at enhancing recruitment and career development. 
                    Our goal is to create a dynamic space that connects students, job seekers, and recruiters, effectively closing the gap between education and employment.

                Currently in its early startup phase, Nexclap has already established partnerships with various companies across different sectors in the San Francisco Bay Area.

            On the technical front, I'm working on developing core features such as an in-house chatroom and video conferencing tool, as well as a dashboard and a community-driven social network feed. This setup is designed to facilitate direct interactions between recruiters and students. 
            Moreover, it enables students to showcase their portfolios, and post content or other project work directly to a network of active recruiters.
