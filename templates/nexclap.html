            Moreover, we're excited about introducing a unique system of badges. These badges serve as certifications or merits, highlighting a user's skills and achievements, thereby increasing their visibility and credibility to potential employers.

            On the technical front, I'm working on developing core features such as an in-house chatroom, video conferencing, and a dashboard. These tools are designed to streamline the interaction between career advisors, recruiters, and our users, making the process of scheduling appointments and meetings seamless.
